MultiSmsWidget
==============

This was my first contact with qt, respective kde. I wrote a standalone-gui as well as a widget for the kde-desktop.

The app sends sms via urllib2 (so website-like) and is easy extendable by pluins.

Thanks to my educationcompany <a href="http://puzzle.ch">Puzzle</a> for the permission to make that public.

Wont work at the moment, at least not for full.. Widget maybe do. Using python2, need rewrite!
